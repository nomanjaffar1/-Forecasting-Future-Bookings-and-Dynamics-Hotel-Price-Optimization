This repository encompasses a CSV file capturing bookings and reservations data for Hotel X as of 2024-02-12, featuring room types, StayDate, BookingDate, Price, and ReservationId. Addressing three key questions, the first focuses on forecasting, requiring the development of an algorithm predicting bookings and revenue at the RoomType & StayDate level, validated against historical data and projected for Feb 2024 - Nov 2024. The second question involves performance analysis, evaluating Hotel X's future performance based on historical room-type data, defining KPIs, and creating a bot to communicate results. Lastly, the third question delves into price optimization, proposing a Reinforcement Learning algorithm for dynamic pricing recommendations and implementing a simulation algorithm for evaluation. Collaborative efforts with domain experts and rigorous validation are emphasized throughout the tasks.
